## Future

> Implement MapQuest API to provide more accurate location data for airports and cities.

> Migrate from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript to improve the app's performance and maintainability.

> Develop a Progressive Web App (PWA) version of Travel Advisor to allow users to access the app offline and enjoy a faster, more immersive experience.
